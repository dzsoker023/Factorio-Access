Computes a 1-based modulus.

In most languages, with 0-based indices, a useful way to "go in circles" such
that always increasing an index iterates over an array over and over, is to do
`i % len(array))` which, as i increments, will repeat from 0 to len(array) over
and over.  In Lua, we have one-based indices.  mod1 is the same operation as %
in a zero-based language, but offset so that it works with lua tables.

E.g. given 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6, and mod1(i, 3), you get 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3

function mod.mod1(index, length)
   return ((index - 1) % length) + 1
