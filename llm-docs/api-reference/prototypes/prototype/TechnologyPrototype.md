## Examples

```
{
  type = "technology",
  name = "steel-processing",
  icon_size = 256,
  icon = "__base__/graphics/technology/steel-processing.png",
  effects =
  {
    {

  {
    count = 50,
    ingredients = {{"automation-science-pack", 1}},
    time = 5
  },
  order = "c-a"
}
```

## Properties

### name

If this name ends with `-<number>`, that number is ignored for localization purposes. E.g. if the name is `technology-3`, the game looks for the `technology-name.technology` localization. The technology tree will also show the number on the technology icon.

**Type:** `string`

**Required:** Yes

**Overrides parent:** Yes

### icons

Can't be an empty array.

**Type:** Array[`IconData`]

**Optional:** Yes

### icon

Path to the icon file.

### icon_size

The size of the square icon, in pixels. E.g. `32` for a 32px by 32px icon. Must be larger than `0`.

The base game uses 256px icons for technologies.

  [...]
  upgrade = true
}
```

### enabled

This can be `false` to disable the technology at the start of the game, or `true` to leave it enabled.

Changes to this property do not affect existing save files, as the enabled state is saved in the save file and not reloaded from the prototype.
