# ItemGroup

An item group. Item groups are the tabs shown above the list of craftable items in the player's inventory GUI. The built-in groups are "logistics", "production", "intermediate-products" and "combat" but mods can define their own.

Items are sorted into item groups by sorting them into a [subgroup](prototype:ItemPrototype::subgroup) which then belongs to an [item group](prototype:ItemSubGroup::group).

**Parent:** [Prototype](Prototype.md)
**Type name:** `item-group`
**Instance limit:** 255

## Examples

```
{
  type = "item-group",
  name = "logistics",
  order = "a",
  icon = "__base__/graphics/item-group/logistics.png",
  icon_size = 128,
}
```
