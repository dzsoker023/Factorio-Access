`__1__`: remaining durability

`__2__`: total durability

`__3__`: durability as a percentage

So when a locale key that has the following translation

`Remaining durability is __1__ out of __2__ which is __3__ %`

is applied to a tool with 2 remaining durability out of 8 it will be displayed as

`Remaining durability is 2 out of 8 which is 25 %`

### infinite

Whether this tool has infinite durability. If this is false, `durability` must be specified.
