# EntityPrototype

Abstract base of all entities in the game. Entity is nearly everything that can be on the map (except tiles).

For in game script access to entity, take a look at [LuaEntity](runtime:LuaEntity).

**Parent:** [Prototype](Prototype.md)
**Abstract:** Yes

## Examples

```
{
  type = "container",
  name = "wooden-chest",
  icon = "__base__/graphics/icons/wooden-chest.png",
  flags = { "placeable-neutral", "player-creation" },
  minable = { mining_time = 1, result = "wooden-chest" },
  max_health = 100,
  corpse = "small-remnants",
  collision_box = { {-0.35, -0.35}, {0.35, 0.35} },
  fast_replaceable_group = "container",
  selection_box = { {-0.5, -0.5}, {0.5, 0.5} },
  inventory_size = 16,
  open_sound = { filename = "__base__/sound/wooden-chest-open.ogg" },
  close_sound = { filename = "__base__/sound/wooden-chest-close.ogg" },
  picture =
  {
    filename = "__base__/graphics/entity/wooden-chest/wooden-chest.png",
    priority = "extra-high",
    width = 46,
    height = 33,
    shift = {0.25, 0.015625}
  }
}
```

## Properties

### icons

This will be used in the electric network statistics, editor building selection, and the bonus gui. Can't be an empty array.

Either this or `icon` is mandatory for entities that have at least one of these flags active: `"placeable-neutral"`, `"placeable-player`", `"placeable-enemy"`.

**Type:** Array[`IconData`]

**Optional:** Yes

### icon

Path to the icon file.

Either this or `icons` is mandatory for entities that have at least one of these flags active: `"placeable-neutral"`, `"placeable-player`", `"placeable-enemy"`.

Only loaded if `icons` is not defined.

**Type:** `FileName`

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

```
icon = "__base__/graphics/icons/wooden-chest.png"
```

### icon_size

The size of the square icon, in pixels. E.g. `32` for a 32px by 32px icon. Must be larger than `0`.

Only loaded if `icons` is not defined.

**Type:** `SpriteSizeType`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 64

### collision_box

Specification of the entity collision boundaries. Empty collision box means no collision and is used for smoke, projectiles, particles, explosions etc.

The `{0,0}` coordinate in the collision box will match the entity position. It should be near the center of the collision box, to keep correct entity drawing order. The bounding box must include the `{0,0}` coordinate.

Note, that for buildings, it is customary to leave 0.1 wide border between the edge of the tile and the edge of the building, this lets the player move between the building and electric poles/inserters etc.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "Empty = `{{0, 0}, {0, 0}}`"

**Examples:**

```
collision_box = {{-0.4, -0.4}, {0.4, 0.4}}
```

### collision_mask

Defaults to the mask from [UtilityConstants::default_collision_masks](prototype:UtilityConstants::default_collision_masks) when indexed by the entity type.

**Type:** `CollisionMaskConnector`

**Optional:** Yes

### map_generator_bounding_box

Used instead of the collision box during map generation. Allows space entities differently during map generation, for example if the box is bigger, the entities will be placed farther apart.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "The value of collision_box."

### selection_box

Specification of the entity selection area. When empty the entity will have no selection area (and thus is not selectable).

The selection box is usually a little bit bigger than the collision box. For tileable entities (like buildings) it should match the tile size of the building.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "Empty = `{{0, 0}, {0, 0}}`"

**Examples:**

```
selection_box = {{-0.5, -0.5}, {0.5, 0.5}}
```

### drawing_box_vertical_extension

Specification of extra vertical space needed to see the whole entity in GUIs. This is used to calculate the correct zoom and positioning in the entity info gui, for example in the entity tooltip.

**Type:** `double`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 0.0

**Examples:**

```
drawing_box_vertical_extension = 0.5
```

### sticker_box

Used to specify the area where the [sticker](prototype:StickerPrototype) animation can appear for entities that can have stickers on them.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "The value of collision_box."

**Examples:**

```
sticker_box = {{-0.5, -0.5}, {0.5, 0.5}}
```

### hit_visualization_box

Where beams should hit the entity. Useful if the bounding box only covers part of the entity (e.g. feet of the character) and beams only hitting there would look weird.

**Type:** `BoundingBox`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "Empty = `{{0, 0}, {0, 0}}`"

### trigger_target_mask

Defaults to the mask from [UtilityConstants::default_trigger_target_mask_by_type](prototype:UtilityConstants::default_trigger_target_mask_by_type).

**Type:** `TriggerTargetMask`

**Optional:** Yes

### flags

**Type:** `uint8`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** 1

### remove_decoratives

Whether this entity should remove decoratives that collide with it when this entity is built. When set to "automatic", if the entity type is considered [a building](runtime:LuaEntityPrototype::is_building) (e.g. an assembling machine or a wall) it will remove decoratives.

**Type:** `"automatic"` | `"true"` | `"false"`

**Optional:** Yes

**Default:** "automatic"

### emissions_per_second

Amount of emissions created (positive number) or cleaned (negative number) every second by the entity. This is passive and currently used just for trees and fires.

This allows you to replace an entity that's already placed, with a different one in your inventory. For example, replacing a burner inserter with a fast inserter. The replacement entity can be a different rotation to the replaced entity and you can replace an entity with the same type.

This is simply a string, so any string can be used here. The entity that should be replaced simply has to use the same string here.

Entities with the same fast replaceable group can be configured as upgrades for each other in the upgrade planner. Refer to the [upgrade planner prototype's page](prototype:UpgradeItemPrototype) the full requirements for entities to be shown in the upgrade planner.

**Type:** `EntityID` | Array[`EntityID`]

**Optional:** Yes

### additional_pastable_entities

Names of the entity prototypes this entity prototype can be pasted on to in addition to the standard supported types.

This is used to allow copying between types that aren't compatible on the C++ code side, by allowing mods to receive the [on_entity_settings_pasted](runtime:on_entity_settings_pasted) event for the given entity and do the setting pasting via script.

**Type:** Array[`EntityID`]

**Optional:** Yes

**Examples:**

```
additional_pastable_entities = {"steel-chest", "iron-chest"}
```

### tile_width

Used to determine how the center of the entity should be positioned when building (unless the off-grid [flag](prototype:EntityPrototypeFlags) is specified).

}
```

### order

Used to order prototypes in inventory, recipes and GUIs. May not exceed a length of 200 characters.

The order string is taken from the items in `placeable_by` if they exist, or from an item that has its [place_result](prototype:ItemPrototype::place_result) set to this entity.

**Type:** `Order`

**Optional:** Yes

**Overrides parent:** Yes
