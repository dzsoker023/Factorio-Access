# script_raised_revive

A static event mods can use to tell other mods they revived something by script. This event is only raised if a mod does so with [LuaBootstrap::raise_event](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_event) or [LuaBootstrap::raise_script_revive](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_script_revive), or when `raise_revive` is passed to [LuaEntity::revive](runtime:LuaEntity::revive).
