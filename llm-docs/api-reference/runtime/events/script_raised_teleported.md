# script_raised_teleported

A static event mods can use to tell other mods they teleported something by script. This event is only raised if a mod does so with [LuaBootstrap::raise_event](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_event) or [LuaBootstrap::raise_script_teleported](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_script_teleported), or when `raise_teleported` is passed to [LuaControl::teleport](runtime:LuaControl::teleport).
