This only allows mods to queue research that this force is able to research in the first place. As an example, an already researched technology or one whose prerequisites are not fulfilled will not be queued, but dropped silently instead.

It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.
