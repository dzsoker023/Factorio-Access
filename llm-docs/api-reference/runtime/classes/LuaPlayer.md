# LuaPlayer

A player in the game. Pay attention that a player may or may not have a character, which is the [LuaEntity](runtime:LuaEntity) of the little guy running around the world doing things.

**Parent:** [LuaControl](LuaControl.md)

## Attributes

The current position of this player's physical controller.

**Read type:** `MapPosition`

### physical_vehicle

The current vehicle of this player's physical controller.

**Read type:** `LuaEntity`

**Optional:** Yes

### character

The character attached to this player, if any. Returns `nil` when the player is disconnected (see [LuaPlayer::connected](runtime:LuaPlayer::connected)).

**Read type:** `LuaEntity`

**Write type:** `LuaEntity`

**Optional:** Yes

### cutscene_character

When in a cutscene; the character this player would be using once the cutscene is over, if any. Returns `nil` when the player is disconnected (see [LuaPlayer::connected](runtime:LuaPlayer::connected)).

**Read type:** `LuaEntity`

**Optional:** Yes

### index

This player's index in [LuaGameScript::players](runtime:LuaGameScript::players) (unique ID). It is assigned when a player is created, and remains so (even when the player is not [connected](runtime:LuaPlayer::connected)) until the player is irreversibly [removed](runtime:on_player_removed). Indexes of removed players can be reused.

**Read type:** `uint32`

### gui

**Read type:** `LuaGui`

### opened_self

`true` if the player opened itself. I.e. if they opened the character or god-controller GUI.

**Read type:** `boolean`

### controller_type

**Read type:** `defines.controllers`

### physical_controller_type

The player's "physical" controller. When a player is in the remote controller, this specifies the controller they will return to. When the player is not in the remote controller, this is equivalent to [LuaPlayer::controller_type](runtime:LuaPlayer::controller_type).

**Read type:** `defines.controllers`

### stashed_controller_type

The stashed controller type, if any. This is mainly useful when a player is in the map editor.

**Read type:** `defines.controllers`

**Optional:** Yes

### spidertron_remote_selection

All SpiderVehicles currently selected by the player, if they are holding a spidertron remote.

**Read type:** Array[`LuaEntity`]

**Write type:** Array[`LuaEntity`]

**Optional:** Yes

### zoom

The current player controller's zoom level. Must be positive. The baseline zoom level is 1. Values greater than 1 will zoom in closer to the world and values between 0 and 1 will zoom out away from the world.

Writing values outside the current zoom limits is always valid, but read values will always be clamped to the range defined by [LuaPlayer::zoom_limits](runtime:LuaPlayer::zoom_limits).

**Read type:** `double`

**Write type:** `double`

### zoom_limits

The player's current controller's zoom limits.

Reading this field creates a copy, so modifying the returned table's fields directly will not alter the player's zoom limits. To change the zoom limits for the player's current controller, set the entire field to the desired [ZoomLimits](runtime:ZoomLimits) table.

Zoom limits are defined and remembered per controller type. If you set the zoom limits of the character controller, then every time the player uses the character controller, it will remember and use the zoom limits previously set. However, other controller types will not use the character controller zoom limits; each controller type must have its zoom limits defined separately.

To set the zoom limits of ANY controller type, not just the currently active one, use [LuaPlayer::set_zoom_limits](runtime:LuaPlayer::set_zoom_limits).

**Read type:** `ZoomLimits`

**Write type:** `ZoomLimits`

During [on_player_created](runtime:on_player_created), this attribute will always return a scale of `1`. To get the actual scale, listen to the [on_player_display_density_scale_changed](runtime:on_player_display_density_scale_changed) event raised shortly afterwards.
