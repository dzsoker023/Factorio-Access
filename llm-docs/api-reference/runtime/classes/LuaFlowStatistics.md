# LuaFlowStatistics

Encapsulates statistic data for different parts of the game.

In the context of flow statistics, `input`, `output` and `storage` describe in which position of the associated GUI the values are shown. Input values are shown on the far left side, output values to the immediate right, and storage values (if present) to the far right.

- The item production GUI shows "consumption" on the right, thus `output` describes the item consumption numbers. The same goes for fluid consumption.

- The kills GUI shows "losses" on the right, so `output` describes how many of the force's entities were killed by enemies.

- The electric network GUI shows "power consumption" on the left side, so in this case `input` describes the power consumption numbers. In addition, electric networks are currently the only ones that utilize the `storage` part of their statistics, showing accumulator charges to the far right of the GUI.

### force

The force these statistics belong to. `nil` for pollution statistics.

**Read type:** `LuaForce`

**Optional:** Yes

### valid

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.

**Read type:** `boolean`

### object_name

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

**Read type:** `string`

## Methods

### get_current_input_sample

Gets the current-tick input sample for a given prototype.

These values get merged into the input counts at the end of the tick.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.

**Returns:**

- `double`

### set_current_input_sample

Sets the current-tick input sample for a given prototype.

These values get merged into the input counts at the end of the tick.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `count` `double` - The new count.

### get_current_output_sample

Gets the current-tick output sample for a given prototype.

These values get merged into the output counts at the end of the tick.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.

**Returns:**

- `double`

### set_current_output_sample

Sets the current-tick output sample for a given prototype.

These values get merged into the output counts at the end of the tick.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `count` `double` - The new count.

### get_input_count

Gets the total input count for a given prototype.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.

**Returns:**

- `uint64` | `double`

### set_input_count

Sets the total input count for a given prototype.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `count` `uint64` | `double` - The new count. The type depends on the instance of the statistics.

### get_output_count

Gets the total output count for a given prototype.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.

**Returns:**

- `uint64` | `double`

### set_output_count

Sets the total output count for a given prototype.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `count` `uint64` | `double` - The new count. The type depends on the instance of the statistics.

### get_storage_count

Gets the total storage count for a given prototype.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.

**Returns:**

- `uint64` | `double`

### set_storage_count

Sets the total storage count for a given prototype.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `count` `uint64` | `double` - The new count. The type depends on the instance of the statistics.

### get_flow_count

Gets the flow count value for the given time frame. If `sample_index` is not provided, then the value returned is the average across the provided precision time period. These are the values shown in the bottom section of the statistics GUIs.

Use `sample_index` to access the data used to generate the statistics graphs. Each precision level contains 300 samples of data so at a precision of 1 minute, each sample contains data averaged across 60s / 300 = 0.2s = 12 ticks.

All return values are normalized to be per-tick for electric networks and per-minute for all other types.

**Parameters:**

- `name` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `category` `string` - The statistics category to read from. Valid choices are `"input"`, `"output"` and `"storage"`.
- `precision_index` `defines.flow_precision_index` - The precision to read.
- `sample_index` `uint16` *(optional)* - The sample index to read from within the precision range. If not provided, the entire precision range is read. Must be between 1 and 300 where 1 is the most recent sample and 300 is the oldest.
- `count` `boolean` *(optional)* - If true, the count of items/fluids/entities is returned instead of the per-time-frame value.

**Returns:**

- `double`

### on_flow

Adds a value to this flow statistics.

**Parameters:**

- `id` `FlowStatisticsID` - The prototype ID.
- `count` `float` - The count: positive or negative determines if the value goes in the input or output statistics.

### clear

Reset all the statistics data to 0.
