# LuaRemote

Registry of interfaces between scripts. An interface is simply a dictionary mapping names to functions. A script or mod can then register an interface with [LuaRemote](runtime:LuaRemote), after that any script can call the registered functions, provided it knows the interface name and the desired function name. An instance of LuaRemote is available through the global object named `remote`.

## Attributes

### interfaces

List of all registered interfaces. For each interface name, `remote.interfaces[name]` is a dictionary mapping the interface's registered functions to `true`.

**Read type:** Dictionary[`string`, Dictionary[`string`, `True`]]

### object_name

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

**Read type:** `string`
