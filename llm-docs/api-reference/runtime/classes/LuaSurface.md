# LuaSurface

A "domain" of the world, such as a planet or space platform. Surfaces are uniquely identified by their name. Every game contains at least the surface "nauvis".

## Attributes

### name

The name of this surface. Names are unique among surfaces.

The default surface can't be renamed.

**Read type:** `string`

**Write type:** `string`

### index

This surface's index in [LuaGameScript::surfaces](runtime:LuaGameScript::surfaces) (unique ID). It is assigned when a surface is created, and remains so until it is [deleted](runtime:on_surface_deleted). Indexes of deleted surfaces can be reused.

**Read type:** `uint32`

### map_gen_settings

The generation settings for this surface. These can be modified after surface generation, but note that this will not retroactively update the surface. To manually regenerate it, [LuaSurface::regenerate_entity](runtime:LuaSurface::regenerate_entity), [LuaSurface::regenerate_decorative](runtime:LuaSurface::regenerate_decorative), and [LuaSurface::delete_chunk](runtime:LuaSurface::delete_chunk) can be used.

**Read type:** `MapGenSettings`

**Write type:** `MapGenSettings`

### generate_with_lab_tiles

When set to true, new chunks will be generated with lab tiles, instead of using the surface's map generation settings.

Defines how surface daytime brightness influences each color channel of the current color lookup table (LUT).

The LUT is multiplied by `((1 - weight) + brightness * weight)` and result is clamped to range `[0, 1]`.

Default is `{0, 0, 0}`, which means no influence.

**Read type:** `ColorModifier`

**Write type:** `ColorModifier`

### count_entities_filtered

Count entities of given type or name in a given area. Works just like [LuaSurface::find_entities_filtered](runtime:LuaSurface::find_entities_filtered), except this only returns the count. As it doesn't construct all the wrapper objects, this is more efficient if one is only interested in the number of entities.

- If no `area` or `position` are given, the entire surface is searched.

**Parameters:**

- `filter` `EntitySearchFilters`

**Returns:**

- `uint32`

### count_tiles_filtered

Count tiles of a given name in a given area. Works just like [LuaSurface::find_tiles_filtered](runtime:LuaSurface::find_tiles_filtered), except this only returns the count. As it doesn't construct all the wrapper objects, this is more efficient if one is only interested in the number of tiles.

If no `area` or `position` and `radius` is given, the entire surface is searched. If `position` and `radius` are given, only tiles within the radius of the position are included.

**Parameters:**

- `filter` `TileSearchFilters`

**Returns:**

- `uint32`

### find_non_colliding_position

Find a non-colliding position within a given radius.

Special care needs to be taken when using a radius of `0`. The game will not stop searching until it finds a suitable position, so it is important to make sure such a position exists. One particular case where it would not be able to find a solution is running it before any chunks have been generated.

### set_tiles

Set tiles at specified locations. Can automatically correct the edges around modified tiles.

Placing a [mineable](runtime:LuaTilePrototype::mineable_properties) tile on top of a non-mineable or [foundation](runtime:LuaTilePrototype::is_foundation) one will turn the latter into the [LuaTile::hidden_tile](runtime:LuaTile::hidden_tile) for that tile. Placing a mineable non-foundation tile on a mineable non-foundation one or a mineable foundation tile on a mineable foundation one will not modify the hidden tile. This restriction can however be circumvented by using [LuaSurface::set_hidden_tile](runtime:LuaSurface::set_hidden_tile). Placing a non-foundation tile on top of a foundation one when there already exists a hidden tile will push hidden tile to [double hidden](runtime:LuaTile::double_hidden_tile), and foundation tile will turn into hidden. Placing a mineable foundation tile over a mineable non-foundation tile with hidden mineable foundation tile, the hidden tile will be replaced by previously double hidden tile and double hidden tile will be erased. Placing a non-mineable tile will erase hidden and double hidden tiles.

It is recommended to call this method once for all the tiles you want to change rather than calling it individually for every tile. As the tile correction is used after every step, calling it one by one could cause the tile correction logic to redo some of the changes. Also, many small API calls are generally more performance intensive than one big one.

**Parameters:**

- `tiles` Array[`Tile`]
- `correct_tiles` `boolean` *(optional)* - If `false`, the correction logic is not applied to the changed tiles. Defaults to `true`.
- `remove_colliding_entities` `boolean` | `"abort_on_collision"` *(optional)* - Defaults to `true`.
- `remove_colliding_decoratives` `boolean` *(optional)* - Defaults to `true`.
- `raise_event` `boolean` *(optional)* - Defaults to `false`.
- `player` `PlayerIdentification` *(optional)* - The player whose undo queue to add these actions to.
- `undo_index` `uint32` *(optional)* - The index of the undo item to add this action to. An index of `0` creates a new undo item for it. Defaults to putting it into the appropriate undo item automatically if not specified.

### pollute

**Parameters:**

- `source` `MapPosition` - Where to spawn the pollution.
- `amount` `double` - How much pollution to add.

Defaults to `0`, which equals a resolution of `1x1` tiles, centered on tile centers. Values range from `-8` to `8` inclusive, where each integer increment doubles/halves the resolution. So, a resolution of `-8` equals a grid of `256x256` tiles, and a resolution of `8` equals `1/256` of a tile.
- `max_gap_size` `int32` *(optional)* - Defines the maximum allowed distance between path waypoints. 0 means that paths must be contiguous (as they are for biters). Values greater than 0 will produce paths with "gaps" that are suitable for spiders. Allowed values are from `0` to `31`. Defaults to `0`.
- `max_attack_distance` `double` *(optional)* - Defines the maximum allowed distance between the last traversable path waypoint and an obstacle entity to be destroyed. Only used when finding a discontiguous path, i.e. when `max_gap_size` > 0. This field filters out paths that are blocked by obstacles that are outside the entity's attack range. Allowed values are `0` or greater. Defaults to `max_gap_size`.
