# LuaGameScript

Main toplevel type, provides access to most of the API though its members. An instance of LuaGameScript is available as the global object named `game`.

## Attributes

### allow_debug_settings

Whether players who are not [admins](runtime:LuaPlayer::admin) can access all debug settings. Set this to false to disallow access to most debug settings for non-admins.

The following debug settings are always available to all players: `"show-fps"`, `"show-playtime"`, `"show-clock"`, `"show-time-to-next-autosave"`, `"show-detailed-info"`, `"show-time-usage"`, `"show-entity-time-usage"`, `"show-gpu-time-usage"`, `"show-sprite-counts"`, `"show-particle-counts"`, `"show-collector-navmesh-time-usage"`, `"show-lua-object-statistics"`, `"show-heat-buffer-info"`, `"show-multiplayer-ups"`, `"show-multiplayer-waiting-icon"`, `"show-multiplayer-statistics"`, `"show-multiplayer-server-name"`, `"show-debug-info-in-tooltips"`, `"show-resistances-in-tooltips-always"`, `"hide-mod-guis"`, `"show-tile-grid"`, `"show-blueprint-grid"`, `"show-intermediate-volume-of-working-sounds"`, `"show-decorative-names"`, `"allow-increased-zoom"`, `"show-train-no-path-details"`, `"show-entity-tick"`, `"show-update-tick"`

**Read type:** `boolean`

**Write type:** `boolean`

### player

This property is only populated inside [custom command](runtime:LuaCommandProcessor) handlers and when writing [Lua console commands](https://wiki.factorio.com/Console#Scripting_and_cheat_commands). Returns the player that is typing the command, `nil` in all other instances.

See [LuaGameScript::players](runtime:LuaGameScript::players) for accessing all players.

**Read type:** `LuaPlayer`

**Optional:** Yes

### players

Get a table of all the players that currently exist. This sparse table allows you to find players by indexing it with either their `name` or `index`. Iterating this table with `pairs()` will provide the `index`es as the keys. Iterating with `ipairs()` will not work at all.

If only a single player is required, [LuaGameScript::get_player](runtime:LuaGameScript::get_player) should be used instead, as it avoids the unnecessary overhead of passing the whole table to Lua.

**Read type:** LuaCustomTable[`uint32` | `string`, `LuaPlayer`]

### map_settings

The currently active set of map settings. Even though this property is marked as read-only, the members of the dictionary that is returned can be modified mid-game.

This does not contain difficulty settings, use [LuaGameScript::difficulty_settings](runtime:LuaGameScript::difficulty_settings) instead.

**Read type:** `MapSettings`

### difficulty_settings

The currently active set of difficulty settings. Even though this property is marked as read-only, the members of the dictionary that is returned can be modified mid-game.

**Read type:** `DifficultySettings`

### difficulty

Current scenario difficulty.

**Read type:** `defines.difficulty`

### forces

Get a table of all the forces that currently exist. This sparse table allows you to find forces by indexing it with either their `name` or `index`. Iterating this table with `pairs()` will provide the `name`s as the keys. Iterating with `ipairs()` will not work at all.

**Read type:** LuaCustomTable[`uint32` | `string`, `LuaForce`]

### console_command_used

Whether a console command has been used.

**Read type:** `boolean`

### simulation

Simulation-related functions, or `nil` if the current game is not a simulation.

**Read type:** `LuaSimulation`

### tick

Current map tick.

**Read type:** `MapTick`

### ticks_played

The number of ticks since this game was created using either "new game" or "new game from scenario". Notably, this number progresses even when the game is [tick_paused](runtime:LuaGameScript::tick_paused).

This differs from [LuaGameScript::tick](runtime:LuaGameScript::tick) in that creating a game from a scenario always starts with this value at `0`, even if the scenario has its own level data where the `tick` has progressed past `0`.

**Read type:** `MapTick`

### tick_paused

If the tick has been paused. This means that entity update has been paused.

**Read type:** `boolean`

**Write type:** `boolean`

### ticks_to_run

The number of ticks to be run while the tick is paused.

When [LuaGameScript::tick_paused](runtime:LuaGameScript::tick_paused) is true, ticks_to_run behaves the following way: While this is > 0, the entity update is running normally and this value is decremented every tick. When this reaches 0, the game will pause again.

**Read type:** `uint32`

**Write type:** `uint32`

### finished

True while the victory screen is shown.

**Read type:** `boolean`

### finished_but_continuing

True after players finished the game and clicked "continue".

**Read type:** `boolean`

### speed

Speed to update the map at. 1.0 is normal speed -- 60 UPS. Minimum value is 0.01.

**Read type:** `float`

**Write type:** `float`

### surfaces

Get a table of all the surfaces that currently exist. This sparse table allows you to find surfaces by indexing it with either their `name` or `index`. Iterating this table with `pairs()` will provide the `name`s as the keys. Iterating with `ipairs()` will not work at all.

**Read type:** LuaCustomTable[`uint32` | `string`, `LuaSurface`]

### planets

**Read type:** LuaCustomTable[`string`, `LuaPlanet`]

### connected_players

The players that are currently online.

This does *not* index using player index. See [LuaPlayer::index](runtime:LuaPlayer::index) on each player instance for the player index. This is primarily useful when you want to do some action against all online players.

**Read type:** Array[`LuaPlayer`]

### permissions

**Read type:** `LuaPermissionGroups`

### backer_names

Array of the names of all the backers that supported the game development early on. These are used as names for labs, locomotives, radars, roboports, and train stops.

**Read type:** `boolean`

**Write type:** `boolean`

### object_name

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

**Read type:** `string`

The three built-in forces (player, enemy and neutral) can't be destroyed, meaning they can't be used as the source argument to this function.

The source force is not removed until the end of the current tick, or if called during the [on_forces_merging](runtime:on_forces_merging) or [on_forces_merged](runtime:on_forces_merged) event, the end of the next tick.
