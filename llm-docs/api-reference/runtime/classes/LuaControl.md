## Methods

### get_inventory

Get an inventory belonging to this entity. This can be either the "main" inventory or some auxiliary one, like the module slots or logistic trash slots.

A given [defines.inventory](runtime:defines.inventory) is only meaningful for the corresponding LuaObject type. EG: get_inventory(defines.inventory.character_main) is only meaningful if 'this' is a player character. You may get a value back but if the type of 'this' isn't the type referred to by the [defines.inventory](runtime:defines.inventory) it's almost guaranteed to not be the inventory asked for.

**Parameters:**

- `inventory` `defines.inventory`

**Returns:**

- `LuaInventory` *(optional)* - The inventory or `nil` if none with the given index was found.

### get_inventory_name

### teleport

Teleport the entity to a given position, possibly on another surface.

Some entities may not be teleported. For instance, transport belts won't allow teleportation and this method will always return `false` when used on any such entity.

You can also pass 1 or 2 numbers as the parameters and they will be used as relative teleport coordinates `'teleport(0, 1)'` to move the entity 1 tile positive y. `'teleport(4)'` to move the entity 4 tiles to the positive x.

`script_raised_teleported` will not be raised if teleporting a player with no character.

**Parameters:**

- `position` `MapPosition` - Where to teleport to.
- `surface` `SurfaceIdentification` *(optional)* - Surface to teleport to. If not given, will teleport to the entity's current surface. Only players, cars, and spidertrons can be teleported cross-surface.
