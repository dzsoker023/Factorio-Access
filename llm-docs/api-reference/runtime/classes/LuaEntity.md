# LuaEntity

The primary interface for interacting with entities through the Lua API. Entities are everything that exists on the map except for tiles (see [LuaTile](runtime:LuaTile)).

Most functions on LuaEntity also work when the entity is contained in a ghost.

**Subclasses:** Inserter

### active

A deactivated entity will stop all of its operations (car will stop moving, inserters will stop working, fish will stop moving, etc).

Reading from this returns `false` if the entity is deactivated in at least one of the following ways: [by script](runtime:LuaEntity::disabled_by_script), [by circuit network](runtime:LuaEntity::disabled_by_control_behavior), [by recipe](runtime:LuaEntity::disabled_by_recipe), [by freezing](runtime:LuaEntity::frozen), or by being marked for deconstruction.

### mine

Mines this entity.

'Standard' operation is to keep calling `LuaEntity.mine` with an inventory until all items are transferred and the items dealt with.

**Parameters:**

- `inventory` `LuaInventory` *(optional)* - If provided the item(s) will be transferred into this inventory. If provided, this must be an inventory created with [LuaGameScript::create_inventory](runtime:LuaGameScript::create_inventory) or be a basic inventory owned by some entity.
- `force` `boolean` *(optional)* - If true, when the item(s) don't fit into the given inventory the entity is force mined. If false, the mining operation fails when there isn't enough room to transfer all of the items into the inventory. Defaults to false. This is ignored and acts as `true` if no inventory is provided.
- `raise_destroyed` `boolean` *(optional)* - If true, [script_raised_destroy](runtime:script_raised_destroy) will be raised. Defaults to `true`.
- `ignore_minable` `boolean` *(optional)* - If true, the minable state of the entity is ignored. Defaults to `false`. If false, an entity that isn't minable (set as not-minable in the prototype or isn't minable for other reasons) will fail to be mined.
