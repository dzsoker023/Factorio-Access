# LuaBootstrap

Entry point for registering event handlers. It is accessible through the global object named `script`.

## Attributes

### mod_name

The name of the mod from the environment this is used in.

**Read type:** `string`

### level

Information about the currently running scenario/campaign/tutorial.

**Read type:** Table (see below for parameters)

### active_mods

A dictionary listing the names of all currently active mods and mapping them to their version.

**Read type:** Dictionary[`string`, `string`]

### feature_flags

A dictionary of feature flags mapping to whether they are enabled.

**Read type:** Table (see below for parameters)

### object_name

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

**Read type:** `string`

## Methods

### on_init

Register a function to be run on mod initialization.

This is only called when a new save game is created or when a save file is loaded that previously didn't contain the mod. During it, the mod gets the chance to set up initial values that it will use for its lifetime. It has full access to [LuaGameScript](runtime:LuaGameScript) and the [storage](auxiliary:storage) table and can change anything about them that it deems appropriate. No other events will be raised for the mod until it has finished this step.

For more context, refer to the [Data Lifecycle](auxiliary:data-lifecycle) page.

**Parameters:**

- `handler` function() | `nil` - The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.

**Examples:**

```
-- Initialize a `players` table in `storage` for later use
script.on_init(function()
  storage.players = {}
end)
```

### on_load

Register a function to be run on save load. This is only called for mods that have been part of the save previously, or for players connecting to a running multiplayer session.

It gives the mod the opportunity to rectify potential differences in local state introduced by the save/load cycle. Doing anything other than the following three will lead to desyncs, breaking multiplayer and replay functionality. Access to [LuaGameScript](runtime:LuaGameScript) is not available. The [storage](auxiliary:storage) table can be accessed and is safe to read from, but not write to, as doing so will lead to an error.

The only legitimate uses of this event are these:

- Re-setup [metatables](https://www.lua.org/pil/13.html) as they are not persisted through the save/load cycle.

- Re-setup conditional event handlers, meaning subscribing to an event only when some condition is met to save processing time.

- Create local references to data stored in the [storage](auxiliary:storage) table.

For all other purposes, [LuaBootstrap::on_init](runtime:LuaBootstrap::on_init), [LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed](runtime:LuaBootstrap::on_configuration_changed) or [migrations](auxiliary:migrations) should be used instead.

For more context, refer to the [Data Lifecycle](auxiliary:data-lifecycle) page.

**Parameters:**

- `handler` function() | `nil` - The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.

### on_configuration_changed

Register a function to be run when mod configuration changes.

This is called when the game version or any mod version changed, when any mod was added or removed, when a startup setting has changed, when any prototypes have been added or removed, or when a migration was applied. It allows the mod to make any changes it deems appropriate to both the data structures in its [storage](auxiliary:storage) table or to the game state through [LuaGameScript](runtime:LuaGameScript).

For more context, refer to the [Data Lifecycle](auxiliary:data-lifecycle) page.

**Parameters:**

- `handler` function(`ConfigurationChangedData`) | `nil` - The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.

### on_event

Register a handler to run on the specified event(s). Each mod can only register once for every event, as any additional registration will overwrite the previous one. This holds true even if different filters are used for subsequent registrations.

**Parameters:**

- `event` `LuaEventType` | Array[`LuaEventType`] - The event(s) or custom-input to invoke the handler on.
- `handler` function(`EventData`) | `nil` - The handler for this event. Passing `nil` will unregister it.
- `filters` `EventFilter` *(optional)* - The filters for this event. Can only be used when registering for individual events.

**Examples:**

```
-- Register for the on_tick event to print the current tick to console each tick
script.on_event(defines.events.on_tick,
function(event) game.print(event.tick) end)
```

```
-- Register for the on_built_entity event, limiting it to only be received when a `"fast-inserter"` is built
script.on_event(defines.events.on_built_entity,
function(event) game.print("Gotta go fast!") end,
{{filter = "name", name = "fast-inserter"}})
```

### on_nth_tick

Register a handler to run every nth-tick(s). When the game is on tick 0 it will trigger all registered handlers.

**Parameters:**

- `tick` `MapTick` | Array[`MapTick`] | `nil` - The nth-tick(s) to invoke the handler on. Passing `nil` as the only parameter will unregister all nth-tick handlers.
- `handler` function(`NthTickEventData`) | `nil` - The handler to run. Passing `nil` will unregister it for the provided nth-tick(s).

### register_on_object_destroyed

Registers an object so that after it's destroyed, [on_object_destroyed](runtime:on_object_destroyed) is called.

Once an object is registered, it stays registered until it is actually destroyed, even through save/load cycles. The registration is global across all mods, meaning once one mod registers an object, all mods listening to [on_object_destroyed](runtime:on_object_destroyed) will receive the event when it is destroyed. Registering the same object multiple times will still only fire the destruction event once, and will return the same registration number.

Depending on when a given object is destroyed, [on_object_destroyed](runtime:on_object_destroyed) will either be fired at the end of the current tick or at the end of the next tick.

**Parameters:**

- `object` `RegistrationTarget` - The object to register.

**Returns:**

- `uint64` - The registration number. It is used to identify the object in the [on_object_destroyed](runtime:on_object_destroyed) event.
- `uint64` - The [useful identifier](runtime:RegistrationTarget) of the object if it has one or `0` if it doesn't. This identifier is specific to the object type, for example for trains it is the value [LuaTrain::id](runtime:LuaTrain::id).
- `defines.target_type` - Type of the target object.

### register_metatable

Register a metatable to have linkage recorded and restored when saving/loading.

The metatable itself will not be saved. Instead, only the linkage to a registered metatable is saved, and the metatable registered under that name will be used when loading the table.

`register_metatable()` can not be used in the console, in event listeners or during a `remote.call()`.

The metatable first needs to be defined in the mod's root scope, then registered using this method. From then on, it will be properly restored for tables in [storage](auxiliary:storage).

```
local metatable =
{
  __index = function(key)
    return "no value for key " .. key
  end
}
script.register_metatable("my_metatable", metatable)
```

This previously defined `metatable` can then be set on any table as usual:

```
local table = {key="value"}
setmetatable(table, metatable)
```

**Parameters:**

- `name` `string` - The name of this metatable. Names must be unique per mod.
- `metatable` `table` - The metatable to register.

### generate_event_name

Generate a new, unique event ID that can be used to raise custom events with [LuaBootstrap::raise_event](runtime:LuaBootstrap::raise_event).

**Returns:**

- `defines.events` - The newly generated event ID. This will be a new value that does not correspond to any named entry in defines.events.

### get_event_id

Converts LuaEventType into related value of defines.events. Value will be provided also if event was not given a constant inside of defines.events.

**Parameters:**

- `event` `LuaEventType`

**Returns:**

- `defines.events`

### get_event_name

Converts LuaEventType into corresponding event name. If event has no name, no value will be given.

**Parameters:**

- `event` `LuaEventType`

**Returns:**

- `string` *(optional)*

### get_event_handler

Find the event handler for an event.

**Parameters:**

- `event` `LuaEventType` - The event identifier to get a handler for.

**Returns:**

- function(`EventData`) *(optional)* - Reference to the function currently registered as the handler, if it was found.

### get_event_order

Gets the mod event order as a string.

**Returns:**

- `string`

### set_event_filter

Sets the filters for the given event. The filters are only retained when set after the actual event registration, because registering for an event with different or no filters will overwrite previously set ones.

Limit the [on_marked_for_deconstruction](runtime:on_marked_for_deconstruction) event to only be received when a non-ghost entity is marked for deconstruction.

```
script.set_event_filter(defines.events.on_marked_for_deconstruction, {{filter = "ghost", invert = true}})
```

Limit the [on_built_entity](runtime:on_built_entity) event to only be received when either a `unit` or a `unit-spawner` is built.

```
script.set_event_filter(defines.events.on_built_entity, {{filter = "type", type = "unit"}, {filter = "type", type = "unit-spawner"}})
```

Limit the [on_entity_damaged](runtime:on_entity_damaged) event to only be received when a `rail` is damaged by an `acid` attack.

```
script.set_event_filter(defines.events.on_entity_damaged, {{filter = "rail"}, {filter = "damage-type", type = "acid", mode = "and"}})
```

**Parameters:**

- `event` `LuaEventType` - ID of the event to filter.
- `filters` `EventFilter` *(optional)* - The filters or `nil` to clear them.

### get_event_filter

Gets the filters for the given event.

**Parameters:**

- `event` `LuaEventType` - ID of the event to get.

**Returns:**

- `EventFilter` *(optional)* - The filters or `nil` if none are defined.
