# LuaWireConnector

A wire connector of a given entity. Allows to find wires, add or remove wires and do some basic operations specific to those connectors.

## Attributes

### owner

The entity this wire connector belongs to. May return entity ghost instead if this wire connector belongs to inner entity.

**Read type:** `LuaEntity`

### wire_type

The type of wires that can be connected to this connector.

**Read type:** `defines.wire_type`

### wire_connector_id

Identifier of this connector in the entity this connector belongs to.

**Read type:** `defines.wire_connector_id`

### is_ghost

If this connector is owned by an entity inside of a ghost. If any of 2 ends of a wire attaches to a ghost connector, then a wire is considered to be a ghost.

**Read type:** `boolean`

### connection_count

Amount of wires going out of this connector. It includes all wires (ghost wires and real wires).

**Read type:** `uint32`

### connections

All wire connectors this connector is connected to. It includes all wires (ghost wires and real wires).

**Read type:** Array[`WireConnection`]

### real_connection_count

Amount of real wires going out of this connector. It only includes wires for which both wire connectors are real (not ghosts).

**Read type:** `uint32`

### real_connections

All wire connectors this connector is connected to with real wires. It only includes wires that are between two non-ghost entities.

**Read type:** Array[`WireConnection`]

### network_id

Index of a CircuitNetwork or ElectricSubNetwork which is going through this wire connector. Returns 0 if there is no network associated with this wire connector right now. CircuitNetwork indexes are independent of indexes of ElectricSubNetwork so they may collide with each other.

**Read type:** `uint32`

### electric_network

The electric sub network this copper wire connector provides.

No value will be provided if this is not a copper wire connector. May be `nil` in case of a copper wire connector when it belongs to a ghost or its from a power switch when there are no real wires connecting it to other entities.

**Read type:** `LuaElectricSubNetwork`

**Optional:** Yes

### valid

Is this object valid? This Lua object holds a reference to an object within the game engine. It is possible that the game-engine object is removed whilst a mod still holds the corresponding Lua object. If that happens, the object becomes invalid, i.e. this attribute will be `false`. Mods are advised to check for object validity if any change to the game state might have occurred between the creation of the Lua object and its access.

**Read type:** `boolean`

### object_name

The class name of this object. Available even when `valid` is false. For LuaStruct objects it may also be suffixed with a dotted path to a member of the struct.

**Read type:** `string`

## Methods

### is_connected_to

Checks if this connector has any wire going to the other connector.

**Parameters:**

- `target` `LuaWireConnector` - Other connector to check for a connection to.
- `origin` `defines.wire_origin` *(optional)* - Origin of the wire. Defaults to `defines.wire_origin.player`.

**Returns:**

- `boolean`

### connect_to

Connects this connector to other wire connector.

**Parameters:**

- `target` `LuaWireConnector` - Other connector to which a wire should be added.
- `reach_check` `boolean` *(optional)* - True by default. For wires out of reach or on different surfaces, `false` must be provided.
- `origin` `defines.wire_origin` *(optional)* - Origin of the wire. Defaults to `defines.wire_origin.player`.

**Returns:**

- `boolean` - Whether a connection was made.

### disconnect_from

Disconnects this connector from other wire connector.

**Parameters:**

- `target` `LuaWireConnector` - Other connector to which wire to be removed should be removed.
- `origin` `defines.wire_origin` *(optional)* - Origin of the wire. Defaults to `defines.wire_origin.player`.

**Returns:**

- `boolean` - Whether a connection was removed.

### disconnect_all

Removes all wires going out of this wire connector.

**Parameters:**

- `origin` `defines.wire_origin` *(optional)* - Origin of the wires to remove. Defaults to `defines.wire_origin.player`.

**Returns:**

- `boolean` - True if any wire was removed.

### can_wire_reach

Checks if a wire can reach from this connector to the other connector.

**Parameters:**

- `other_connector` `LuaWireConnector` | `LuaEntity` - Target to which a wire reach is to be checked.

**Returns:**

- `boolean`

### have_common_neighbour

Checks if this and other wire connector have a common neighbour.

**Parameters:**

- `other_connector` `LuaWireConnector` - Other connector to check for common neighbour.
- `ignore_ghost_neighbours` `boolean` *(optional)*

**Returns:**

- `boolean`
