--[[
The ability to add methods to something, while keeping it safe to save in
global.

This is how one gets nice APIs like the Factorio entities, where one can
`thing.whatever()`.  Inheritance is not supported, and at least for now fields
on the table must not have the same name as methods, or the field takes
priority.

This is a hard problem because Factorio cannot pass functions through global,
nor can it restore metatables, unless those metatables are registerd during
control.lua startup.

This module exposes one function, `link`.  It is called like:

```
-- A table of functions. They will be called as f(instance, user, supplied, arguments)
--
-- They must be declared exactly once at module level. They cannot thus contain
-- closures.
local method_table = {}

-- We can use the Lua method declaration syntax and self, to add methods to
-- this table.
function method_table:a_method(an_arg)
   -- Lua adds self for you, this is actually function(self, a_method).
   -- self is a valid variable here, referring to the "instance" (like Python).
end

-- Somewhere, at the top level, make this call, though probably
-- with better naming:
local linker = link_methods('a_unique_string', methods_table)

-- And then to make a "instance", in a function or wherever.  This is the magic.
return linker(instance)
```

Where a_unique_string is unique for the lifetime of the *save*, and the method
table is unique for the lifetime of this run.  That is, the unique string
"names" the methods, but the methods can change (e.g. adding new ones,
renaming...).  This doesn't care whether or not the code moves, or if it's in
the module it was in, or anything--that string just has to be fixed.

There are some minor catches:

- The implementation uses a field _methods_private for itself. This is opaque;
  do not access it.
- As above, no closures, and methods need to be registered at module top level.
- And again as above, no fields with the same names as methods.
- Also, there is a slight perf impact. It shouldn't matter, just don't use this
  in tight math loops.

# Implementation

This is actually just a metatable trick: register new metatables with factorio
on declaration of methods, capturing the methods so declared.  The wrapper then
just installs the unique metatable.
