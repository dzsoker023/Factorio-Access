Audio rulers.

A ruler triggers when the cursor touches or crosses its boundaries and plays a
sound.  Right now there is one ruler per player and no interaction with cursor
skipping.  Both of these will change later.  For the sake of the prototype,
players place a ruler with alt+b and clear with alt+shift+b.  If they want to
also have a bookmark there, we make them do so themselves.

We return an opaque handle which may safely be stored in global, and we (for
now) use that ourselves.  The long term plan as of 2024-08-02 is to integrate
this functionality with fast travel, so in future a handle will simply go live
over there with fast travel points.

As promised in uid.lua, an explanation of the handle:

- Rulers are in a table<number, Ruler>
- Handles hold a pindex (so we know which player it was for), the reference to
  the table (so that we need not take the overhead of looking it up, and so that
  code is simpler) and this unique id.
- When deleting, the handle clears out it's table reference, then uses the
  unique id to go   delete the ruler from global.
- Then the ruler handle switches itself off effectively by just asserting that
  the table reference is still there.  This gives users of the API a clear
  message if they are trying to use rulers they deleted by throwing an error,
  rather than let them hold a reference this module knows nothing about.

For now this is a demonstrational prototype, which means that all handles do is
delete.  Once they get integrated into fast travel, however, they will need to
support being reconfigured--functions on this "class" is where that belongs.

In practice right now it is one ruler per player; the handle is stashed in the
`handle` field of our global per-player state.

You can think of this like a Java class except with some ceremony that lets it
live in global.
