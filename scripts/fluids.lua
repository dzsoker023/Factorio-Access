Get data about (but do not announce directly) the fluid states of an entity.

As a brief overview: entities have fluidboxes.  Each fluidbox is a "tank" of one kind of fluid.  Boilers for example
have one for water and one for steam.  Some fluidboxes are connected to the external world, usually via a direct pipe
connection but sometimes via underground connections instead.

One special case is pipes.  These have fluidboxes but we treat them specially, because announcing 4 fluidboxes is
entirely unhelpful.  For that we compute corner shapes and such and provide helpful descriptions.

Old versions of the mod hardcoded much of this.  The trick to not hardcoding it is to know that one needs
get_pipe_connections, and then relative directions to the *box* of the entity they belong to provide what is needed
there. `get_simplified_connections` in this file handles the magic of converting an entity's fluidboxes into tile
coordinates and other info that is useful for announcement and analysis on our side.

What's actually going on: `get_connections` returns the connected fluidboxes if any.  That is, it returns an empty table
for e.g. a lonely pipe. `get_pipe_connections` instead figures out where connections are going, and returns all of them
even if they are not connected right now (that is, it seems to have nothing to do with pipes).  This is however done per
fluidbox, and each fluidbox is one fluid only, so to get the overview for the whole entity one must iterate.

Now for limitations on fluid contents: for that, the API calls it filters and it works like splitter or belt
filters--but for a whole fluidbox, including all connections (for example the two boiler water inputs are one fluidbox
and one filter for that fluidbox).  Storage tanks are an example of an entity with many connections and one un-filtered
fluidbox.

The fluidbox indexing operator itself allows indexing the fluids in a fluidbox. Most of the time it's up to 1.  It's
unclear if or under what circumstances it can be more than 1, but it is probably possible for that to happen.  As of
2024-11-04, it is unclear to us just when that can happen in the new fluid system.

There is a concept of locked fluids.  The API doesn't do a good job of explaining this.  If a fluid is locked, this
means that it is on something that produces or consumes that fluid.  This doesn't happen on pipes or storage tanks, but
it does happen on crafting machines when recipes are set.

Note: the logic for determining pipe shapes (corner, T, cross, etc.) was formerly part of this file, but is now shared
via `network-shape.lua`, and reused by both fluids and heat systems.

Given a pipe entity, determine to which pipes it is connected and pass back information on the shape.  This comes back
as two values, a kind and a direction. Shape interpretations are as follows:

- straight: a line of 3 segments and this pipe is the middle. Direction is either north or east, specifying if it is
  vertical or horizontal.
- end: has one connection. Direction is the way the end "points" e.g. 180 from the connection.
- corner: an L formed of 3 pipe segments.  The direction is the corner of the imaginary box which would be formed of 4
  corners.  For example, northwest means connecting south and east, because if you completed the box it'd be the
  northwest corner.
- Cross: direction is returned as north.  Looks like a cross, which is invariant under rotation.
- alone: nothing connects, will just pass back north.
- T: the direction is the top of the T, e.g. the missing one.

This mismatches fa-info.  The trouble is that the above directions make sense for analysis and exposing them directly
would be the least verbose option, but that relies on blind people knowing what a T is, and figuring out what "northwest
corner" means--we'd have to teach it.  We probably do at some point, but that's not now, so fa-info simplifies.

This function considers only pipe entities, and ignores undergrounds. Undergrounds need to be announced separately.
