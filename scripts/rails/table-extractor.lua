---Rail Table Extractor
---
---This module extracts comprehensive geometric and connectivity data for all rail piece -types in Factorio 2.0. The
--extracted data is used by the rail navigation system to -understand rail geometry without hardcoding piece-specific
--logic.
---
---# What the Extracted Table Contains
---
---The table structure is: -``` -[prototype_type][placement_direction] = {
---  grid_offset = { x, y },                              -- API placement offset from requested origin
---  bounding_box = { left_top, right_bottom, orientation? },  -- Collision box (may be oriented)
---  occupied_tiles = { {x, y}, ... },              -- Integer tile coordinates relative to entity
---  [end_direction] = {                            -- One entry per rail end
---    signal_locations = { ... },                  -- Signal placement locations
---    extensions = {                               -- Possible next rail pieces
---      [goal_direction] = { ... }
---    }
---  } -} -```
---
---# Rail Types
---
---Factorio 2.0 has four rail piece types:
---  - straight-rail: Simple straight segment
---  - half-diagonal-rail: 45-degree diagonal segment
---  - curved-rail-a: Longer curve (connects cardinal <-> diagonal)
---  - curved-rail-b: Tighter curve (connects diagonals)
---
---# Directions
---
---Rails use 16-way directions (defines.direction), with pieces placeable in 8 directions -(even values 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
--10, 12, 14). Direction strings like "north", "northeast", -"east" are used for readability.
---
---# Coordinate System
---
---ALL coordinates in the extracted table are relative to the rail piece's actual position -after placement, NOT the
--requested origin. This handles API offsets where the game -places rails at adjusted positions due to grid alignment
--constraints.
---
---The `grid_offset` field records the offset: actual_position - requested_position
---
---Occupied tiles use integer coordinates representing tile indices, not world positions.
---
---# Data Fields
---
---## grid_offset -The offset applied by the API when placing the rail. For example, half-diagonal rails -can only be placed
--on odd coordinates, so the API may grid_offset the position by (1, 1).
---
---## bounding_box -The collision bounding box from LuaEntity.bounding_box, relative to entity position. -Contains
--left_top and right_bottom corners. May include an orientation field if the -box is rotated (making it an oriented
--bounding box, not axis-aligned).
---
---## occupied_tiles -Array of {x, y} integer tile coordinates showing which tiles the rail occupies, -relative to the
--entity's center. Used for collision detection and spatial queries.
---
---## end_direction -Each rail piece has two ends (front/back). The table has one entry per end, keyed by -the end's
--direction. Each end contains:
---
---### signal_locations -Locations where signals can be placed for this rail end:
---  - in_signal: Main entrance signal position/direction
---  - out_signal: Exit signal position/direction
---  - alt_in_signal: Alternative entrance signal (if exists)
---  - alt_out_signal: Alternative exit signal (if exists)
---
---### extensions -Possible rail pieces that can connect to this end, keyed by goal_direction. -Each extension contains:
---  - prototype: The rail type (straight-rail, curved-rail-a, etc.)
---  - position: Where to place the connecting piece
---  - direction: Which direction to place it facing
---  - goal_position: Where the connection point ends up
---  - goal_direction: Direction of the far end of the connecting piece
---
---# How Data is Extracted
---
---For each rail type and direction: -1. Place the rail at origin (0, 0) -2. Record actual position (may differ due to
--API offsets) -3. Scan tiles in 32x32 area to find occupied tiles -4. Query both rail ends using LuaRailEnd API -5. For
--each end, extract signal locations and possible extensions -6. Make all positions relative to actual entity position
---7. Destroy the rail and move to next
---
---# Usage
---
---Called by /railtable command to regenerate the rail geometry table when needed -(e.g., after game updates or to
--verify patterns).
