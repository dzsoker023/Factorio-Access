"pointers" to fields in tables.

Consider the circuit network.  It has a number of control behaviors of the form
[ off, or, some, other, options ], where one has a pair of fields--one for the
off/on state and one for the other options.  If we can refer to these fields in
a generic way, then we can pass references to them around and just tell the code
what labels to use this time.  Much of Factorio is like this: some set of fields
pretty similar to each other, and some labels/options that vary.

This module returns a magic table.  You use it like this:

```
local F = require('field-ref')
local reference = F.a.b.c() -- The parens are required.
-- reference may now be used to work with x.a.b.c on anything that has an a.b.c:
local example ={ a = { b = { c = 5 } } }
assert(reference.get(example) == 5)
-- Or you can set it
reference.set(10)
assert(reference.get(example) == 10)
```

An error is thrown if the path encounters a nil on any of the intermediate steps
to the final value but will return nil for the final value itself.

Field references cannot be stored in global.

(If you just want to use it, you can stop here. Devs who want to know how it
works, read on).

# Implementation

Firstly, paths look like:

```
{ "a", "field", "indexed", "with", 5 }
-- is x.a.field.indexed.with[5]
```

Recall that lua makes no distinction between `a.b` and `a["b"]`--from the
perspective of the C API they're the same thing.  That's why this works on
Factorio objects.

The actual handling is a metatable trick.  Firstly, metatables only let one
intercept indices which are new.  The way this works is that you can put a
metatable on an empty table and that metatable can point at whatever else to
override indexing, and the empty table can just remain empty forever.

Now the problem is, since paths are tables technically the user could modify
them after the fact by trying to continue it.  To deal with this, we clone the
path on every step instead of writing a new one.  The actual indexing step is
fast, and the performance hit in creation is fine because presumably no one
wants to build these all the time.

For sanity we then just assert that the user is not trying to "compile" an empty
path.
