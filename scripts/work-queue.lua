--[[
A work queue takes some number of work items and runs them across some number of
ticks.  This is used to amortize the cost of long-running operations across
ticks so that UPS stays reasonable.

To use it, call declare_work_queue to make a work queue.  This will wire up a
queue which will call a specified function and use a specified key in storage
for the state.  Queues cannot currently be shared or stored in storage by the
user--they're singletons.  This may later be fixed with a migration which kills
the work_queues key of storage, then starts returning a full state.  That's not
hard, as one can use a similar trick to scripts.ds.clusterer, just not worth it
as of this writing (2024-09-05).  Note that such a replacement must also solve
being registered with a central registry, which is a non-obvious problem.
Otherwise they can't advance with this module's on_tick.

Each enqueued item is of whatever form the caller wants and consequently can
carry state or etc.  For more complex patterns the last item enqueued by the
caller will be called last and can be used to update structures external to the
queue model.  These items are stored in storage and cannot contain functions or
closures directly.  Instead, use a key that indexes into a table of your own to
get the function when the item runs.

It is safe to modify (including clearing) the work queue while inside an item's
callback.

For modules which wish to respawn work (e.g. scanner), a function
`idle_function` may be specified. This gets called if there is a tick where the
queue is empty.
